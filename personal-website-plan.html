        <h2>Target audience</h2>

        <p>
            Adventure blogging has become very popular in the last few years. 
            Even more specifically adventure van blogs. 
            The target audience for this site would be people who enjoy traveling,
            adventure, van enthusiasts, hiking enthusiasts, as well as people who 
            are looking for tips and tricks to making camping easier. People who are interested 
            in 4x4 van conversions could be interested in this site as well. Also, people 
            looking for ideas about cooking in the woods!

        <h2>Site purpose</h2>

        <p>
          This website will give viewers a look inside a life of van life 
          adventuring. The site will feature photography, tips and tricks 
          for essential camping gear, camp cooking recipes that can be prepared at home
          ahead of a trip. In the future I would like to add how-to videos (provided
          by my husband) that would detail different aspects of completing a 4x4 conversion.
