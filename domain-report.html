        <h1>What is a domain name?</h1>
        <p>
            A domain name is a text based name associated with the numerical protocols of a website.
             Domain names are also used to indicate ownership or control of the website. It basically 
             provides users with an easy to remember name to find your site.    
        </p>
        <h1>Why are domain names so important?</h1>
        <p>On a basic level, domain names are important because without them, users would have to find 
          or memorize IP addresses, which is a string of numbers associated with a site. Having a domain 
          name also makes your business look more credible and could attract business. Having your own 
          domain name can also make your business appear forward thinking and tech-savvy. 
        </p>
        <h1>Why do domain names have to be unique?</h1>
        <p>Having a unique domain name is important because then no two companies can have the same 
          domain, causing confusion for potential customers. 
        </p>
          <h1>Domain name registrar pricing</h1>
          <p>There are quite a few different registrars for domain names. Namecheap.com seems to be a 
            good option as well as domain.com and bluehost.com. I am interested in purchasing a domain 
            name to actually use this blog in the future and the name I had hoped to use was vanwilder.com. 
            That domain is not available because it is associated with the movie, Van Wilder. I then decided 
            to change the name of my blog to “The Adventures of Van Wilder”.
