        <h3>The Most Beautiful Thing I Have Ever Seen</h3>
        Three years ago my husband and I went to Southern Utah for 10 days to go hiking. Zion National Park is the most beautiful place I have ever seen.
        We hiked Angel's Landing which is a terrifying hike up a very narrow ridge where you are basically pulling yourself up with a chain hooked into the 
        ground at various points. We also hiked the Narrows, which is a river hike. You spend most of the time hiking up river. In August that wasn't so bad 
        because it was in the mid 90's every day.
