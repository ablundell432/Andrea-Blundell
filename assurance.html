        <h1>What does quality assurance mean for web site development?</h1>
        <p>
         Quality assurance make it so that the user or a site has a good experience and has a functional
          interface. Quality Assurance typically involves three things: requirement testing, design evaluation,
           functionality testing. Quality assurance testing should be completed even after the site is complete
            to continually assure the highest quality product.       
        </p>
        <h1>Describe the two key principles of Quality Assurance: "Fit for purpose" and "Right First Time"?</h1>
        <p>
                Fit for purpose means that the product or service meets its intended purpose. The quality 
                assurance principle right first time means that any mistakes are immediately dealt with. 
        </p>
        <h1>How do web standards relate to web quality?</h1>
        <p>
         The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created guidelines to promote consistency in the code 
         and design of websites and promote accessibility. These standards assures that web pages are 
         designed in a way that would be supported by a wide variety of browsers and computers, including 
         cell phones, tablets, laptops, ect…It also promotes the use of cascading style sheets so that fonts, 
         colors, ect… could be easily edited instead of needing to edit each page individually. Web quality
          relates to web standard because if a person goes to your site and it is not accessible or there are 
          a lot of errors they will find it less trustworthy and will be less likely to buy what you are selling 
          or contact you to ask questions. 
        </p>
          <h1>Describe what Web Accessibility means? What steps can you take to make your site more accessible?</h1>
          <p>
        Web accessibility means that websites are built in such a way that a person with a disability such as:
         hearing, vision, mobility, or cognitive impairment can use it. There are many things that things that
          you can do to make a page more accessible. First, choose a content management system that supports 
          accessibility. Try using just your keyboard to access your site. Use tags, classes, and alt text and 
          use them correctly. Be careful with font and color.
