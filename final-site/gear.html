        <h2>Gear Importance</h2>

       <p>
        I have spent nearly six year camping with my husband and while I definitely don't consider myself an expert, I have picked 
        up quite a few tips and tricks along the way. Everyone has a different idea about what is an essential item for camping. Below are
        some lists that I have determined to be essential items for myself but are probably pretty standard for most people. If you plan to 
        hike on your trip you should also take a look at the Washington Trail Association's 10 essential items you should always carry in your 
        pack.

        <h2>Camp Kitchen</h2>
        
        <p>
            I personally prefer to use items that are reusable. Plates, cups, forks, ect... it means less trash and if you spend a lot of time
            camping, like we do, it saves you money in the long run not having to buy those items for every trip. 

        </p>


        <p>
          <ul>
          <li>Propane (with necessary attatchments)</li>
          <li>Plates</li>
          <li>Bowls</li>
          <li>Cups/mugs</li>
          <li>Stove</li>
          <li>Garbage bags</li>
          <li>Clorox wipes</li>

          <h2>Personal Packing</h2>
  
  
  
          <p>
  
            Something that I have had to do a lot of experimenting with is how many personal items to pack. I am talking about clothes, 
            toiletries, ect... It's typically pretty easy to pack for a couple of days but gets more challenging once you plan to be gone
            for 10 days or so. Something that I have learned is less is more when it comes to packing clothes. We do a lot of backcountry
            camping so facilities (water, toilet, clothes washing) are not available so it's unlikely you will be taking a shower every day. 
            On a 10 day trip we shower, and I use that term loosely, four or five times. A shower could be anything from a coin operated shower
            at a campground to pulling over on the side of the road to take a bath in a lake. So packing clean clothes for every day just takes 
            up space. On a 10 day road trip a lot of the time is usually spent driving which means you aren't getting sweaty or dirty so you can 
            wear the same clothes for a couple days. Below I have listed out the personal items I would recommend for a 10 day trip in the summer 
            time.
